Running make will compile both programs

you can run each prgram individually with:
./P1A3 [number]
./P2A3 [number]

or if you run:
./automate

a bash script will run, that runs through each program with the 6 asked
for input values and redirect the output to outfile.txt, that then gets
echoed back to the termianal in a nice easy to see display

the graph is in the ods file: DataGraphed.ods 
the data used for the graph is in RecordedData.txt

the questions to be answered about which code runs fastest are at the end of the slc report for program 2
